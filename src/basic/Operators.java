        Comparison operators
        Logical operators
        Bitwise operators

        Arithmetic Operators are
        + addition
        - subtraction
        * multiplication
        / division
        % modulus
        ++ increment
        -- decrement

        Assignment Operators
        =
        +=
        -=
        *=
        /=
        %=
        &=
        |=
        ^=
        <<=
        >>=

        Comparison Operators
        == Equal To
        != Not Equal
        < Smaller Than
        > Greater Than
        <= Smaller Than and Equal
        >= Greater Than and Equal

        Logical Operators
        && Logical And ( Return true if both statements are true )
        || Logical Or ( Return true if one of the statement is true )
        ! Logical Not ( Reverse the result, return true if the statement is false, return false if the statement is ture )
